# Design Patterns in Plain English
## The essentials
  - Classes
  - Interfaces
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - UML

## Classes
  - Coupling, when code changes, inherited classes has to be recompiled
  - Same when changing parameters, you have to change all object constructors
## Interfaces
  - A contract that specifies the capabilities a class should provide

## Encapsulation
  - Private classes can modify value inside of the class, but not outside

## Abstraction
  - Reduce Complexity by hiding unnecessary details

## Polymorphism
  - Reduce Complexity by hiding unnecessary details

## Single Responsibility Principle
  - Every class should have a single responsibility

## Memento

## State Pattern
  -
