SHUTDOWN schedules a time for the system to be powered down. It may be used to halt, power-off or reboot the machine.
# shutdown
# shutdown now
# shutdown 13:20  
# shutdown -p now	#poweroff the machine
# shutdown -H now	#halt the machine		
# shutdown -r09:35	#reboot the machine at 09:35am
# shutdown -c		#cancel a pending shutdown

HALT instructs the hardware to stop all CPU functions, but leaves it powered on. You can use it to get the system to a state where you can perform low level maintenance.
# halt		   #halt the machine
# halt -p	   #poweroff the machine
# halt --reboot    #reboot the machine

POWEROFF sends an ACPI signal which instructs the system to power down.
# poweroff   	       #poweroff the machine
# poweroff --halt      #halt the machine
# poweroff --reboot    #reboot the machine

REBOOT instructs the system to restart.
# reboot            #reboot the machine
# reboot --halt     #halt the machine
# reboot -p   	    #poweroff the machine

You could do that by using screen.
Type man screen to find out more or read this screen man page.

Simple scenario:
ssh into your remote box. Type screen Then start the process you want.

Press Ctrl-A then Ctrl-D. This will "detach" your screen session but leave your processes running. You can now log out of the remote box.

If you want to come back later, log on again and type screen -r This will "resume" your screen session, and you can see the output of your process.
